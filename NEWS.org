The APDL-Mode major version number is based on the Ansys version which
was used for updating the help keywords, element names, etc.  For
example apdl-mode-24.0 is based on Ansys 2024 and has the minor
APDL-Mode version number of 0.

* Version 24.0, 20 years of APDL-Mode!
  - Enable the public Ansys online help (when using Ansys 2025R1 or
    newer)
* Version 20.7.0
  - Rework of the APDL menu and new entry: Browse the Customer Portal
    of Ansys
  - Add ".inp" as autoloaded file suffix for apdl-mode (together
    with ".mac", ".dat" and ".ans").
* Version 20.6.0, 15 years of APDL-Mode!
  Improvements, extensions and bug fixes, 2021-09-26 rc1
  - Implemented batch runs with the current script (now C-c C-y) and
    jobname.out inspection (now C-c C-o).
  - Add new keyinding C-c C-n for apdl-no-of-processors
  - Improved highlighting of user variables
  - Improved borderline cases of M-?, the command parameter help
  - Enhanced abbreviations, for example "`ss" (interactive
    section-separator).
  - Improved and updated documentation, for example see the pdf
    version of the introductory tutorial
  - Added customisation section for user templates
  - Outline-minor-mode is now activated by default, with <SHIFT> +
    <TAB> (Emacs 28.1) its folding features became even more helpful
    for larger macro files
  - apdl-start-classic and -start-launcher are now auto-loaded
    commands (They can be run from the mini buffer (M-x), without
    having a file under `apdl-mode')
#  - Fixed help for the APDL `outres' command, thats only a minor bug,
#  - but from Ansys ;-)
