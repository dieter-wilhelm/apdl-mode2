APDL package to do list
* Priorities
1) Makefile(s), Texinfo, TAGS, version strings
2) Check Github source package with package-install-from-file/buffer
   - apdl-24.0.1.tar.gz, when I remove the "pax_global_header" from
     the github archive we can install it with
     package-install-from-file
   - It seems that package.el is reading the apdl-readme.txt?!
   - package.el needs a <name>.el file
   - manual: tar -cvf apdl-24.0.1.tar *el --transform 's,^,apdl-24.0.1/,'
3) How to place release comments (currently only git logs, NEWS.org?)
4) Texinfo
   - .info binary in repo?
5) Melpa
   - standards
   - <NAME>-pgk.el -> <NAME>.el for summary line and headers
6) Rework qr-code on ansys+emacs.png (or cut it out)

* Images, binaries
** Formatting
Github doesn't (yet) understand org-mode attr_html: and #+caption:
[2025-12-24 Mi]

** Storage
Github copilot suggests storing images directly into repo, when the
images are few and don't change often. Alternatives are
- git-lfs
- github pages

* Work
- Gnu coding standards https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/
- Makefile conventions? (Magit example)
- TAGS for emacs replacing version strings
- Elisp checks: https://drewsh.com/emacs-package-github-workflow

* Texinfo
We do not need a directory file "dir", we have to place the
apdl.info/apdl.texi (see Melpa build scripts) file in the apdl content
folder.

* Melpa
- Melpa is supposed to build info files from .texi files?
** recipie
melpa/apdl

* Release proceedures
- Push to upstream / origin
- Tag (lightweight suffices) e.g. "v25.0.0" creates a release, it
  reads from RELEASE_NOTES.org
- Push tag
